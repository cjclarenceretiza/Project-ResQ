## 🌟 About Project ResQ

**Project ResQ** is a real-time, community-driven platform designed to connect local governments, organizations, and citizens for immediate disaster response and volunteer coordination.

* **Volunteer Coordination:** Citizens can easily find, join, and track relevant missions in their area.
* **Real-Time Data:** Connects all stakeholders in real-time to ensure resources and manpower are deployed efficiently where they are needed most.
